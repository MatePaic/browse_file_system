# Browser-based file system

Welcome to a large-scale browser-based file system, functionally similar to Dropboxâ€™s web interface, or to a folder browsing structure! This project is a built using a modern tech stack, including **ASP.NET Core WebAPI** for the backend. The application allows users to browse, search and create folders and files.

## Features

### Backend (ASP.NET WebAPI)
- **Create folders and subfolders**: Implemented creating folders and subfolders in one endpoint(based on parentFolderId -> if null it is rootfolder if not it is subfolder)
- **Create new files in the folders**: Implemented creating files with parentfolder Id.
- **Search files by its exact name within a parent folder and across all files**
- **Delete folders and files**: Deletes folder and files by Id. If you delete folder with files and subfolders, everything inside that folder is deleted.
